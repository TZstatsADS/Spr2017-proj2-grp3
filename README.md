**Project Summary**:

In this project, we developed a shiny app of tobacco using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques. We aim to visualize the correlation between tobacco consumption and its impacts on related diseases, as well as the relationship between tobacco consumption and commercial spendings. Given the desired year, gender and disease type, our app can easily reflect tobacco consumption and disease ratio of all states on leaflet map by different shades of color and different sizes of red circles, along with corresponding value popups. Our goal is to provide a handy tool for healthcare professionals, researchers and hostpitals when they conduct their studies on tobacco.

# Context

### Project 2: Open Data App - an RShiny app development project

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

In this second project of GU4243/GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server
